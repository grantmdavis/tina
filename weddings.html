                <h1>Weddings</h1>
                <p>Your wedding day is one of life's most anticipated and treasured events. The ceremony itself can stop the sands of time - a sacred moment between you and your spouse-to-be, witnessed and embraced by your guests, celebrated and cherished for years to come, only heightened by the ethereal beauty of the human voice. As a frequent wedding soloist, Tina serves as a valuable resource when it comes to selecting vocal music for your special day. The following list of vocal classics can serve as an initial guide to your search.</p>

                <p>Confirm that your venue provides a pianist or organist and that there is a tuned piano or organ on-site. Most religious venues provide a staff keyboardist. If your venue does not provide a keyboard or accompanist, Tina is happy to work with you to obtain one.</p>

                <h2>Rehearsal Dinners</h2>
                <p>Prior to the big day, some couples wish to include an element of music in their rehearsal dinners. This tradition allows for a special time when the members of the wedding party, families, and friends come together one last time before the bride and groom become the new Mr. & Mrs. Should you have a sentimental song that you would like specially sung to your bride- or groom-to-be, or to all of your special guests in general, consult with Tina about the specifics. She will help create your desired sentiment.</p>

                <h2>Pricing</h2>
                <p>Pricing for wedding ceremonies is determined on a case-by-case basis and is contingent upon the following factors: number of musical pieces, difficulty of repertoire, requested additional singer(s)/instrumentalist(s)/keyboard, rehearsal time with accompanist, and travel distance to the event. There also may be a separate fee associated with the accompanist, depending on your venue's arrangement. Be sure to connect with your venue's contact person.</p>

                <h2>Saturday and Sunday Worship Services</h2>
                <p>In addition to singing for wedding ceremonies and celebration of life services, she enjoys the opportunity to give thanks and share her gift at Saturday or Sunday services. She has sung as cantor, soloist, section leader, and substitute for many area churches including St. Michael's, Barrington; Church of the Ascension, Chicago; St. Benedict Catholic Church, Chicago; and First Church of Christ, Scientist in Chicago, Glenview, McHenry, Palatine, Wauconda, and Winnetka. She is knowledgeable about sacred repertoire and Christian traditions and welcomes the opportunity to sing with your church.</p>
