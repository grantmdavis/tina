                <p>Tina Beverly is an American soprano based out of the Chicago metro area. <a href="listen.html">Her voice</a> is regularly recalled as the pinnacle of her collaborative performances. <a href="contact.html">Contact Tina</a> to engage her for your <a href="special.html">special event</a>, <a href="weddings.html">wedding</a>, or sacred occasion (funeral, service cantor, soloist).</p>

                <p>Her illustrious career includes performing Frantik/Cunning Little Vixen, cover for Woglinde/Das Rheingold and Götterdämmerung and the Forest Bird/Siegfried with Lyric Opera of Chicago, Nannetta/Falstaff and Nella/Gianni Schicchi with Indianapolis Opera, Adina/L'elisir d'amore with the Rome Opera Festival, Olympia/Les contes d'Hoffmann with the Aspen Music Festival and Brevard Music Center, and Adele/Die Fledermaus with the Ryan Opera Center (formerly, Lyric Opera Center for American Artists).</p>

                <p>She has performed Zerbinetta's Recitative and Aria in concert under Sir Andrew Davis as a "rising star" with the Lyric Opera Orchestra, as the Dew Fairy/Hansel and Gretel with University of Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Mahler's Fourth and Strauss' Voci di primavera with Park Ridge Civic Orchestra, and in recital with Chicago's Harold Washington Public Library, American Opera Society of Chicago, Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago, Unity Temple concert series, in a duet recital with the Spoleto Festival in Italy, and with the Chicago Cultural Center's Dame Myra Hess concert series, broadcast live on Chicago's 98.7, WFMT.</p>

                <p>She has won first prize from competitions sponsored by the Musicians Club of Women in Chicago, NATS, Bel Canto Chorus of Milwaukee, and the Society of American Musicians as well as competition awards from the Musicians Club of Women, Union League & Civic Arts Foundation (Chicago), the Bel Canto Foundation (Chicago), American Bach Society (Bethlehem, PA), American Opera Society of Chicago, Friedrich Schorr Memorial Prize in Voice (Adrian, MI), Bel Canto Scholarship Vocal Competition (Providence, RI), MTNA (Albuquerque, NM), and the Nicholas Loren Vocal Competition.</p>

                <p>As an avid performer of Bach, Handel, and Mozart, Tina has performed major works by these composers (as well as other works representative of these periods) including Emira/Handel's Siroe with the Handel Week Festival of Oak Park (American premiere), the title role of Handel's Esther (HWV 50a) with the Callipygian Players with period instruments, and soloist with the Bach Week Festival performing Bach's Kaffee Cantata (BWV 211). Her passion for Bach earned her a fellowship with the Bach Aria Festival & Institute in Stony Brook, NY, where she was able to prime numerous Bach cantata arias. Other significant works include the Bach Magnificat and Vivaldi Gloria with the Riverside Presbyterian Church, Handel's Messiah with the DuPage Symphony Orchestra and with St Ignatius, the Second Woman in Purcell's Dido & Aeneas with the Music of the Baroque, the role of Clarice in Haydn's The World of the Moon, and various Baroque chamber works. Possessing a voice tailor-made for Mozart, she has performed the Mozart Requiem with the Northwest Indiana Symphony Orchestra and New Philharmonic Orchestra, Despina in Così fan tutte, and in The Marriage of Figaro as Susanna with DuPage Opera Theater and as Barbarina with the Florentine Opera in Milwaukee. Her clear voice also lends itself to the music of English and American composers, having performed Tytania in Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream as well as the cover for the Bride in the world premiere of William Bolcom and Robert Altman's opera, A Wedding, at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.</p>

                <p>She received her Master of Music from Boston University (scholarship recipient), her Bachelor of Music and German minor from DePauw University, where she was the recipient of nine awards and scholarships in performance and German and where she was also invited back to teach as an adjunct instructor in voice and music theory, and a Certificato di Frequenza, pre-intermedio, for intensive Italian language study in Rome.</p>

                <p>Her earliest memory of singing dates back to accompanying songs on the radio in the backseat of her parents' car. At age six, she was further inspired after her parents brought her to see the musical Annie at Chicago's Schubert Theater. Shortly thereafter, she began singing in the St. Michael's children's choir, where the director took note and further developed her musical studies by teaching her piano. She continued to study piano through her early years and sing throughout high school, beginning private lessons her sophomore year and finishing her senior year portraying Maria in The Sound of Music, her Dad's favorite role even to this day.</p>

                <p>She is a proud mother of three active children, sings regularly with her church choir and other area churches, and performs at weddings, funerals, parties, and fundraisers.</p>

                <p>She is eternally grateful for the gift of her lifelong voice teacher, Vergene N. Miller, and the support of her family, parents, coaches, professional colleagues, mentors, and friends.</p>
